            <h1>About Healthy Diet</h1>
            <p>Consuming a healthy diet throughout the life-course helps to prevent malnutrition in all its forms as
                well as a range of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) and conditions. However, increased production of
                processed foods, rapid urbanization and changing lifestyles have led to a shift in dietary patterns.
                People are now consuming more foods high in energy, fats, free sugars and salt/sodium, and many people
                do not eat enough fruit, vegetables and other dietary fibre such as whole grains.

                The exact make-up of a diversified, balanced and healthy diet will vary depending on individual
                characteristics (e.g. age, gender, lifestyle and degree of physical activity), cultural context, locally
                available foods and dietary customs. However, the basic principles of what constitutes a healthy diet
                remain the same.
